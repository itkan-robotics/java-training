      "content": "YASS (Yet Another Software Suite) is a collection of libraries designed to simplify FRC robot programming. Its goal is to make advanced features like swerve drive, mechanism control, and vision integration accessible to all teams, regardless of experience level. YASS promotes a philosophy of \"mastering robot programming in days, not years.\"<br><br>The suite includes:<br><strong>YAGSL</strong> (Yet Another General Swerve Library)<br><strong>YAMS</strong> (Yet Another Mechanism System)<br><strong>YAMG</strong> (Yet Another Mechanism Generator)<br><strong>YALL</strong> (Yet Another Limelight Library)<br><br>Learn more: <a href='https://yetanothersoftwaresuite.com/' target='_blank'>YASS Official Website</a>"
