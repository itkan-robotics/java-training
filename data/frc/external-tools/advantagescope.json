      "title": "What is AdvantageScope?",
      "content": "AdvantageScope is a robot data visualization tool focused on analysis. Unlike a dashboard (Shuffleboard) which is for driver control, AdvantageScope is for the developer. It allows you to view log files (WPILOG, RLOG, Hoot) or live data (NT4) with powerful visualizations like 3D field views, graphing, and synchronization with match video.<br><br>It is the companion tool to AdvantageKit but works with any WPILib project that logs data.<br><br>Learn more: <a href='https://docs.advantagescope.org' target='_blank'>AdvantageScope Documentation</a>"

      "content": "<strong>1. Multi-Format Support:</strong> Opens WPILib data logs (.wpilog), AdvantageKit logs (.rlog), CTRE logs (.hoot), and Driver Station logs (.dslog).<br><br><strong>2. 3D Field Visualization:</strong> Visualize your robot's pose, mechanism states (arm angles, elevator heights), and trajectory in full 3D. This is critical for debugging odometry and autonomous paths.<br><br><strong>3. Video Synchronization:</strong> If you have match video, you can sync it with the log data. Clicking a point on the graph jumps the video to that exact moment.<br><br><strong>4. Swerve Visualization:</strong> Dedicated views for swerve module states (vectors) to debug drive issues.<br><br><strong>5. Console Log Review:</strong> Filter and search through robot console output synchronized with the data."

      "title": "Using AdvantageScope with WPILib",
      "content": "To get the most out of AdvantageScope, you should use `DataLogManager` in your WPILib code to record data to a USB stick or the RIO's internal storage.<br><br><strong>Structured Data:</strong> AdvantageScope supports the new WPILib `Struct` serialization. This allows you to log complex objects like `Pose2d`, `Translation2d`, or custom classes efficiently, and AdvantageScope will automatically recognize them as 3D objects or vectors."
