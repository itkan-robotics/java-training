      "content": "GitHub Desktop provides a visual approach to version control that complements command line Git. The GUI makes common operations more accessible by hiding the complexity of Git commands behind intuitive buttons and menus. However, command line Git offers more power and flexibility for advanced operations. Many developers use both tools: GitHub Desktop for daily workflow tasks like committing and pushing, and command line Git for more complex operations like rebasing or resolving difficult conflicts. Understanding when to use each tool helps you work more efficiently."
