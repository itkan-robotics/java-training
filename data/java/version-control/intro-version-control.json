      "title": "What is Version Control?",
      "content": "Version control is a system that tracks changes to files over time, allowing you to recall specific versions later. Think of it as a time machine for your code that saves snapshots of your work at different points."

      "title": "Key Concepts",
      "content": "Version control tracks file changes and maintains a history of all modifications. It enables collaboration between multiple developers by allowing them to work on the same project simultaneously. The system allows you to undo mistakes and revert to previous versions when something goes wrong. It also provides a backup system for your code, ensuring that your work is never lost. Version control is essential for team-based software development and is used by virtually every professional development team."

      "title": "Why Version Control Matters for FTC",
      "content": "Version control is especially important for FTC teams because it enables multiple team members to work on robot code simultaneously, track changes to autonomous routines and teleop programs, revert to working code if new changes break functionality, maintain a history of robot improvements over the season, and collaborate on code reviews and improvements."

      "title": "Understanding Version Control Systems",
      "content": "Version control systems work by creating a complete history of changes to your files. Every time you make a change and commit it, the system stores a snapshot of your entire project at that moment. This creates a timeline of your development process, allowing you to see exactly what changed, when it changed, and who made the changes. Modern version control systems like Git are distributed, meaning every team member has a complete copy of the project history, making collaboration much more efficient and reliable."
