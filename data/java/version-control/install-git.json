Initial configuration requires setting up your user identity so Git knows who is making changes. GitHub Desktop provides a graphical alternative for those who prefer a visual interface over command line tools. Command line Git offers more advanced features and is the standard for professional development. Proper setup ensures smooth collaboration and prevents authentication issues later."

The user.name and user.email settings are used to identify the author of each commit in the project history. The <code>--global</code> flag applies these settings to all your Git repositories on this computer. You can also set repository-specific configurations using the same commands without the <code>--global</code> flag. The <code>git config --list</code> command shows all your current Git settings, helping you verify that everything is configured correctly."
