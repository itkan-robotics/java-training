      "content": "Sensors are electronic devices that allow your robot to perceive its environment. In FTC, sensors are used for tasks like detecting objects, measuring distance, sensing color, and determining orientation. Understanding how to use sensors is crucial for building autonomous and responsive robots. <br><br>For a general overview, see <a href=\"https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/programming_resources/tutorial_specific/onbot_java/using_sensors/Using-Sensors-%28OnBot-Java%29.html\" target=\"_blank\">FTC Docs: Using Sensors in OnBot Java</a>."
