      "title": "What is a Servo?",
      "content": "A servo is a special type of motor designed for precise, controlled movement over a limited range. In FTC, servos are used for mechanisms like arms, claws, and sensors that need to move to specific positions and hold them. Unlike DC motors, servos are not used for continuous rotation (unless they are a special type called continuous rotation servos)."

      "title": "Types of Servos Used in FTC",
      "content": "FTC robots use two main types of servos: standard (positional) and continuous rotation. Standard servos move to a specific position and hold it, while continuous rotation servos spin like a motor. Choosing the right type is important for your mechanism's function."

      "type": "text",
      "title": "How Servos are Controlled in Code",
      "content": "Servos are controlled in code by setting their position (for standard servos) or power (for continuous rotation servos). The position is a value between 0.0 and 1.0, representing the servo's range of motion. You must initialize the servo in your OpMode before using it."
