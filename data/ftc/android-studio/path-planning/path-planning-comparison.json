      "title": "What is PedroPathing?",
      "content": "PedroPathing is a lightweight, easy-to-use path planning library designed specifically for FTC. It focuses on simplicity and quick setup, making it ideal for teams new to advanced path planning. PedroPathing supports basic path following, localization, and simple configuration."

      "type": "text",
      "title": "What is Road Runner?",
      "content": "Road Runner is a powerful, feature-rich motion planning library for FTC. It supports advanced trajectory generation (splines, curves), velocity/acceleration constraints, and integrates with odometry and localization. Road Runner is widely used by top teams for its flexibility and performance, but has a steeper learning curve and more complex setup."
