      "content": "FTC autonomous challenges often require robots to move precisely and efficiently. Road Runner helps teams:<ul><li>Follow complex paths</li><li>Handle localization (knowing where the robot is)</li><li>Chain multiple movements together</li><li>Reduce errors from wheel slip and drift</li></ul>Compared to other libraries, Road Runner is tailored for FTC hardware and field layouts.<br><br>See: <a href=\"https://gm0.org/en/latest/docs/software/advanced/roadrunner/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">gm0: Road Runner Overview</a>"
