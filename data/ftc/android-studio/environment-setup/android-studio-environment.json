      "content": "Android Studio offers powerful features such as code completion, refactoring, integrated version control, and advanced debugging. These tools help teams write robust, maintainable code and collaborate effectively. Android Studio is recommended for advanced users with Java experience, as it provides more flexibility and control than OnBot Java or Blocks."

The SDK ensures your code is compatible with the Robot Controller app and the Android operating system. Essentially, when you push your code to the robot, you are downloading the FTCRobotController app to the Control Hub. As such, it is often helpful to physically connect your Drive Hub to your computer via USB to maintain the WiFI connection between your computer and the Control Hub."
