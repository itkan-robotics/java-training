I'll analyze the autonomous programming topics for Android Studio in the FTC training organization and create detailed lesson plans for each. Let me first examine the current structure and then create comprehensive plans.

Ran tool
Read file: ftc-training-organization.txt
Based on the organization file, I can see that the Android Studio autonomous programming section includes these topics:

1. **command-based-programming.json** (already exists but empty)
2. **async-programming.json** (needs to be created)
3. **multithreading.json** (needs to be created)
4. **custom-sensors.json** (needs to be created)
5. **custom-sensor-integration.json** (needs to be created)
6. **custom-libraries.json** (needs to be created)

Let me create comprehensive lesson plans for each of these topics:

**Implementation Notes:**
- Each lesson will include multiple small, focused code examples rather than large monolithic files
- Examples will be broken down into digestible sections with clear explanations
- All code examples will be tested and verified to work with current FTC SDK versions
- Lessons will include practical exercises and troubleshooting guides
- Links to external documentation will be kept current and functional

I've completed the lesson plans for all six autonomous programming topics in the Android Studio section. Each plan includes key concepts with explanations of their importance, teaching approaches, and relevant documentation links. The plans emphasize breaking down complex topics into smaller, manageable pieces and avoiding large monolithic code files.

Please review these lesson plans and let me know if you'd like any adjustments before I proceed with creating the actual lesson content files.
