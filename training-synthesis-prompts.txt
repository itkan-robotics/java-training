You are writing an FTC training website for students who are new to FTC but already have prior Java programming experience. For each of the topics listed in the [PATH] folder as specified in @ftc-training-organization.txt, plan out what you would talk about within each topic. Base your plans on the documentation I have given you.

For each topic, produce a bullet-point lesson plan listing the key concepts you will cover. For each concept, briefly explain why it is important and how you will teach it. Also specify which documentation you will reference, and provide working links in proper HTML anchor tag form (for example, <a href="link.com" target="_blank">Link</a>) so students can explore on their own.

If a lesson might require a long code example, instead break it into multiple smaller, focused code examples to help students understand each section of the logic in more detail.

Make sure the plan is something you are able to carry out with your capabilities.

If you believe, based on the documentation provided, that there should be more lessons, feel free to include them in the lesson plan as fully fleshed-out lessons.

After you finish outlining every topic in the [SECTION PATH] folder, pause and wait for me to review before continuing. Do not rewrite or edit existing lesson files yet — only produce the lesson plans first, with links and concept breakdowns.

--

Continue from the curriculum plan you built for [SECTION NAMES]. Now, write in new files into [SECTION PATH] to follow the curriculum AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE while still adhering to the documentation. Incorporate the topics, explanations, and references you described. Also incorporate relevant information where APPROPRIATE in the form of HTML reference links (for example, <a href="link.com" target="_blank">Link</a>). If a link is not pertinent and/or not necessary for understanding the content, OMIT it. For all links, ensure they are referring to Android Studio, not OnBot Java or Blocks/Blockly.

Be sure to format the lesson pages in JSON-compatible text or valid HTML, ready for by @script.js managers. When including code, use the appropriate code section type. If the code is too short to be meaningful, expand it to a medium-length snippet that helps students grasp the concept more thoroughly. If a large code block is truly necessary to demonstrate a complete working concept, include it, but only if absolutely required and explain why. Additionally, if you believe you need a large code file, prefer to separate it into more manageable chunks with thorough explanation then assemble the large file at the end of the page, rather than having multiple long code blocks in one file.

Once you finish rewriting ALL of the lesson files, go back and compare the freshly written files to the curriculum. If needed, add any content that is missing from the actual pages.

Once you have verified that each section has a thorough and pertinent explanation, go back through each one and convert any markdown formatting into valid json formatting. Confirm all lesson pages have:
- consistent explanations
- proper json elements
- correct and relevant links
- well-structured code sections
- good logical flow
- only use section types found in @README.md and do not hallucinate new types.

Do NOT stop until ALL files for ALL folders are FULLY rewritten and CHECKED for formatting errors.
After that, update the @ftc-specific-config.json file to reflect the new files made.
